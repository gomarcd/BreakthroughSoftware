I’m very happy to announce that [Easy Voice Recorder](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coffeebeanventures.easyvoicerecorder) has been featured with the prestigious Editors’ Choice badge on Google Play!

To give some background on the app, I began working on the app as a solo developer at the beginning of 2012, and have been working on it ever since. The app has gone through three major redesigns, first to the Holo design theme back around 2013, and again to the modern Material design at the beginning of 2016.

When I started working on the app back in 2012, I was looking for a voice recorder that could capture my grandmother’s stories for posterity, and the apps available at the time all left something to be desired. I saw that there was a place for a voice recorder with a focus on quality and ease of use. I strived to create an app where the tension between simplicity and power would be balanced, where anyone could just install and get going in seconds, while keeping the customizability that power users demand. That is still my goal today.

While I have always developed the app as an independent developer, I have definitely not been alone on this journey. I have much gratitude to everyone who has been part of the journey with me, including my [talented UI designer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rodmaia/), a great QA and customer support team, and also the many users who have pitched in with feedback and translations, not to mention my own family for being supportive from the beginning. I am also very honoured and grateful to Google for validating my efforts, and for building a platform giving small developers like myself the opportunity to work for ourselves and reach a worldwide audience.
