Easy Voice Recorder is App of the Day over at Pocket Lint! Ian Morris wrote a great in-depth and detailed review, bringing to light the different features available, and also noting the troubleshooting section for working around incompatibilities on certain devices!

Here’s a quick excerpt from the review:

> A baby’s first words, a memo to yourself or recording an important interview – all things for which you’ll need a voice recorder.
> 
> Just because the app is free doesn’t mean it doesn’t have some impressive settings. You can select from AMR, AAC or PCM recording modes… There are also options for troubleshooting. For example, with the default settings meant that when the phone went to sleep, the recording stopped. You can fix this here, so make sure you try these settings before heading out for that interview of a lifetime!
