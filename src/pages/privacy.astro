                <strong>Information that you provide voluntarily</strong><br>
                Certain parts of our Services may ask you to provide Personal Data voluntarily. For example, we may ask for certain information in order to use features in our Apps, register an account with us, subscribe to marketing communications from us, and/or to submit enquiries to us, such as:<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; your name, email address or other contact details.<br>

                <strong>Information we collect automatically</strong><br>
                When you use our Services, we may also collect certain information automatically from you and/or your device which may be considered Personal Data under applicable data protection laws, such as:<br>
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; Data and analytics about your use of our Services (e.g. in-app usage, session length, preferred settings, which in-app advertisements you may have viewed, crash reports, and the means by which you were referred to our Services).<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; Your IP address, device identifiers such as your Advertising ID, other device information, and your general geographic location (e.g. country or city location) based on your IP address.<br>
                <br>“Advertising ID” includes the Apple Identifier for Advertisers (“IDFA”) on Apple, and the Google Advertising Identity (“GAID”) on Android. These are unique identifiers for mobile devices that advertisers use for interest-based advertising. They are consistent across all apps and thus allow tracking across apps. These identifiers can be reset from the device’s settings. On Apple, you can opt out by choosing the “limit ad tracking” option in the privacy settings. On Android, you can opt out by choosing “Opt out of interest based ads.”<br>

                Advertising IDs are non-permanent, non-personal identifiers uniquely associated with your device. Similar technologies include tracking pixels within ads. These technologies allow companies (including marketers and advertisers) to recognize your device when you use websites and applications.<br>

                “Device information” means device type, model, manufacturer, operating system and language, or other technical data like supported application programming interfaces (“APIs”), screen size, processor, or a combination of this data, available from a device for a developer to check the device’s compatibility with a particular application.<br>

                In order to better understand our users of the Services, we may conduct research on our customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the information collected.

                The Application makes use of Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting (see https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2799357) which gives Digipom certain demographic and interest information about our Application users. None of this information, however, can identify you personally to Digipom. The information may be used to serve you advertisements that will be of interest to you. You can disable this feature through your Android settings of your Device or the Google Settings App. You can also opt out of such Google advertising at any time by visiting your Google Ads Settings page (see https://www.google.com/settings/ads).<br>

                From time to time, we may also receive Personal Data about you from other third-party sources. For example, if you clicked on an advertisement directing you to one of our Services (such as an ad for one of our Apps in another publishers’ app), we will be provided with Data about which ad network and advertising campaign the install originated from. Please see the Advertising section below for more information.

            <p class="text-dpdarkblue text-opacity-60 text-sm leading-6 mb-4">
                We use advertising to fund our Services and to make some of our apps or versions of our apps available for free. We show third-party advertising in our Apps and also advertise our Services via third parties. We want to provide you with more detail about how we use information for advertising, both in our properties and in third-party properties.

            <p class="text-dpdarkblue text-opacity-60 text-sm leading-6 mb-4">
                <strong>When you view ads in Digipom properties (e.g. in our Apps)</strong><br>
                To enable us to show in-app ads, we may send your advertising ID, IP address and device information to advertisers (or ad networks) to enable them to find appropriate ads to serve to you in our Apps and on third-party properties. You can control and limit our use of your advertising ID in your device settings. Digipom does not control which specific ads are shown in our apps (this is controlled by the ad networks), but we do prohibit certain types of ads.
                Advertising IDs are used by ad networks for a number of purposes, including, for example, to:
            </p>
            <p class="text-dpdarkblue text-opacity-60 text-sm leading-6 mb-4">
                &nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Limit the number of times you see the same ad.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Ensure they are dealing with humans with real devices and not automated “bots”.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Serve you with advertisements likely to be relevant to you based on your advertising ID, your engagement with other brands and ads which is recorded using your advertising ID, and to use your general geographic area.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Other brands may buy ad placements via an ad network or ad exchange to advertise their products in our Apps. The ad network or ad exchange acts as an intermediary between the other app companies and Digipom. In order for the ad network to charge the company purchasing the ad, clicks from the ad and potential installs of other developers’ apps are tracked. These views, clicks and installs from ads are measured using the Advertising ID.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Track which apps you have used to market you similar kind of apps. Your IP address is typically used by advertisers to identify your general geographic location, for example, your country, state and, sometimes, your city.<br>
            </p>
            <p class="text-dpdarkblue text-opacity-60 text-sm leading-6 mb-4">
                <strong>When you view Digipom ads on third-party services</strong><br>
                Digipom also advertises its Apps on other apps by asking ad networks to place ads for audiences that will be interested in them, determined using Advertising IDs. Ad networks use Advertising IDs for this and other purposes, including, for example, to:<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; Measure ad effectiveness (including total views, clicks and installs generated by its advertising in other publishers’ apps),<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; Not display ads for an app a user is already using. Digipom may send a list of active users in the form of Advertising IDs to an ad network. The ad network then excludes these users from seeing the ad.<br>
