                <p class="mb-4">Welcome to the Digipom Applications and Websites. We are confident that you will find our Services useful. These Terms of Use (the “TOU”) cover several different situations, so please refer to the following definitions for clarification:</p>
                <p class="mb-4">“Application” refers to any of the apps for iOS or Android created and owned by Digipom, including but not limited to Easy Voice Recorder (“EVR”), Easy Voice Recorder Pro (“EVR Pro”), Night Filter, and Night Filter Pro. Application also includes any Application updates and upgrades that Digipom may provide to you or make available to you, or that you obtain after the date you obtain your initial copy of an Application, to the extent that such items are not accompanied by a separate Terms of Use. An Application may be specified as either “iOS Application” or “Android Application”, for use in a particular Application’s operating system environment.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">“Device” refers to the handheld or tablet device onto which you downloaded an Application.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">“Digipom” refers to Digipom Inc., a duly incorporated company in the province of Quebec, Canada. Where the present TOU refers to “Digipom”, it may refer to Digipom and / or its employees, officers, directors, subcontractors, agents or representatives, depending on the context. In these TOU, the respective shareholders, officers, directors, employees, agents, partners, principals, representatives, successors and assigns of Digipom and its affiliates may be collectively referred to as “Representatives”. Any reference to “we”, “our”, or “us” in these TOU shall also refer to Digipom. In these TOU, a Website visitor or Services user may be referred to as “you”.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">“Services” are all of the services provided by Digipom, whether any Application, a Website, or any other service provided by Digipom over the internet from time to time, whether for free or for purchase.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">“Website” refers to either of the websites located at http://www.digipom.com or http://www.learnopengles.com/ which are owned and operated by Digipom, and includes all their respective subdomains, present and future.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Additional definitions shall be made throughout these TOU, but they will be recognizable as they will be capitalized, bolded, and in quotation marks. Additional definitions may also be found in the Privacy Policy, and will have the same meaning in these TOU as they do there. The definitions found in these TOU shall also apply to the Privacy Policy.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">By visiting either of the Websites, or downloading, using or accessing an Application on your Device, or clicking or tapping an acceptance box on your computer or Device you hereby accept to be bound by these TOU without any reservations, modifications, additions or deletions. You may also have explicitly accepted the TOU and Privacy Policy following your installation of an Application and launch of the Application for the first time. If you do not agree to all the provisions contained in the TOU, you are not authorized to use the Websites or Services. If you have downloaded an Application and do not agree to all the provisions of the TOU, you must delete the Application from your Device. The TOU are a legal and binding agreement between you and us.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">In the context of an Application, these TOU may also be referred to as, and are equivalent to, an “End User License Agreement” or “EULA”.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Digipom reserves the right, at any time and without prior notice, to modify or replace any of the TOU. Any changes to the TOU can be found at this URL. It is your responsibility to check the TOU periodically for changes. Your use of a Website and / or Application following the posting of any changes to the TOU constitutes acceptance of those changes. If there are any significant changes to the TOU that materially affect your relationship with us, you may be notified via email or upon visiting a Website or opening an Application for the first time after these changes.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">The TOU should be read in conjunction with the Privacy Policy, as both these documents govern your use of the Websites and / or Application.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">If you have any questions about the TOU, please contact:</p>

                <ul class="ml-4 list-decimal list-outside">
                    <li>The Applications are licensed, not sold. Digipom grants you the non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, limited right and license to install and use an Application solely and exclusively for your personal use on the Device, or the use of any other third party with access to the Device that you control and with your permission, and as permitted by the Usage Rules set forth in the App Store Terms and Conditions for an iOS Application or the Google Play Terms of Service for an Android Application. The iOS App Store or Google Play or any other distributor for apps may be referred to in these TOU as a “Third-Party Application Distributor”.</li>
                    <li>You may not use an Application in any manner that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair an Application (or servers or networks connected to an Application), nor may you use an Application in any manner that could interfere with any other party’s use and enjoyment of an Application (or servers or networks connected to an Application).</li>
                    <li>You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Digipom has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) your use of an Application, any breach of your obligations under the TOU, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage, direct or indirect, which Digipom may suffer) of any such breach. Where a third party uses an Application on your Device with your permission, you are solely responsible for conforming to these TOU and any breach thereof shall be your responsibility. Where a third party gains control of your Device without your permission, we strongly suggest taking action (especially a remote wipe or other procedure to lock out your Device) as Digipom cannot be held responsible for any misuse of, or damage to, your Device (whether caused by an Application or not) in such circumstances.</li>
                    <li>You agree that you shall be the sole owner of the end products of your use of EVR or EVR Pro (“Recordings”). You agree that you shall not use the Application to make Recordings in violation of any applicable criminal or civil law, including but not limited to copyright law. Digipom shall in no way be responsible for your use of EVR or EVR Pro or the Recordings (whether in violation of an applicable law or not) and specifically disclaims any responsibility thereto.</li>

                    <li>Our Privacy Policy explains how Digipom treats your Personal Data (as that term is defined in the Privacy Policy) and protects your privacy when you visit a Website or use an Application. By installing, accessing or using an Application or visiting or using a Website you explicitly agree to the use of your data in accordance with the Privacy Policy, which may be updated from time to time and without notice.</li>
                    <li>By installing, accessing or using an Application or visiting a Website, you consent to those information collection and usage terms, including (where applicable) the transfer of data into a country outside of Canada.</li>
                    <li>In addition to personal and non-identifiable information, the Privacy Policy also describes how an Application accesses certain functions of the Device that are not part of an Application and developed by the Device manufacturer as part of the Device’s operating system. These are known as permissions, and you agree that Digipom has the right to access the computer code on your Device in this manner and as described in the Privacy Policy. You may be asked to accept or refuse such permissions by your operating system, and you can always refuse; however if you do so the Application may not function properly, or at all, depending on the permission. Digipom, its affiliates, and their respective Representatives shall not be held responsible for any losses or damages, direct or indirect, pecuniary or non-pecuniary, resulting from an Application not functioning properly when you refuse such permissions.</li>
